    \n Welcome to MINE SEARCH !!!!!!!!!!!! \n
    \n The game consists of clearing all the squares on a screen that do not hide a mine. \n
    Some squares have a number, this number indicates the mines that are in all the surrounding squares. Thus, if a square has the number 3, it means that of the eight squares around it (if it is not in a corner or edge) there are 3 with mines and 5 without mines. If an unnumbered box is discovered it indicates that none of the neighboring boxes have a mine and these are discovered automatically. \n
    If a square with a mine is discovered, the game is lost. \n
    A mark can be placed on the squares that the player thinks there are mines to help figure out which ones are nearby.
